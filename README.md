# HousePricePredictionDashboard
 Here, use of Power BI for house price prediction provides a comprehensive and data-driven approach to understanding the dynamic housing market.
 Through the integration of various data sources and the creation of interactive visualizations, we have gained valuable insights 
 into the factors that contribute to fluctuations in house prices.

Our analysis highlighted the significance of features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, 
and the overall condition of the property in determining house prices. The interactive nature of Power BI allowed us to explore the relationships 
between these variables and visualize their impact on the target variable â€“ house prices.

In summary, Power BI has proven to be an indispensable tool for housing market analysis and price prediction. 
By leveraging its capabilities to gather, visualize, and model data, we can make more informed decisions in the real estate sector. 
However, it's important to remember that while Power BI can provide valuable insights, successful interpretation and decision-making 
require a combinatgoing model optimization.

Before you can perform any analysis or build predictive models, it's essential to ensure that your dataset is clean and accurate. 
Data cleaning involves tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting errors, and transforming data into a suitable format. 
In the context of house price prediction, data cleaning might include:
Handling missing values in features like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.
Removing duplicate records that might skew your analysis.
Standardizing categorical variables like property type or location.

Charts and Visualizations:

For house price prediction, want to create various types of charts and graphs to represent different aspects of your data:
1.Scatter Plots: Visualize the relationship between variables like square footage and price. This can help identify trends and outliers.
2.Bar Charts: Display the distribution of categorical variables like property type,location.
3.Stacked Column Chart:This type of chart can be particularly useful for showing parts-to-whole relationships and tracking changes over price.
4.Filters:The data displayed in related visualizations will automatically adjust based on selections. This allows you to focus on specific data points or categories.
5.Table:Table created for location,Size,Price values![Screenshot (256)](https://github.com/Brindhagithub01/HousePricePredictionDashboard/assets/132831579/0acedc62-be22-4346-8686-75db7d66f5bc)
